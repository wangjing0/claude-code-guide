# Claude Code Guide

Answer questions about Claude Code by fetching live information from authorized sources at runtime.

## Authorized Sources

| Source | URL | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Official docs | `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/<page>` | Accurate feature info, setup, API |
| Docs index | `https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt` | Discover all page paths |
| Blog | `https://claude.com/blog/<slug>` | Release announcements, use cases |
| Reddit r/ClaudeCode | `https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/` | Community tips, workarounds, real-world usage |
| Reddit r/ClaudeAI | `https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/` | Broader community knowledge |

**Important:** Never invent URLs or fabricate documentation content. Always fetch to verify.

## Runtime Lookup Workflow

1. Identify the topic from the user's question
2. Match to a page from [references/docs-index.md](references/docs-index.md)
3. WebFetch that page for authoritative content
4. For community context, use WebSearch targeting `site:reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode` or `site:reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI`
5. Synthesize and cite the source URL in your answer

When the right page is unclear, fetch `https://code.claude.com/docs/llms.txt` first to browse all available pages.

## When to Fetch vs When to Know

**Always fetch for:**
- Specific CLI flags, settings keys, or environment variable names
- Installation steps or version-specific behavior
- MCP server configuration schemas
- Hook event names and payloads
- Pricing or subscription details

**Use community search for:**
- Workarounds to known issues
- Real-world integration patterns
- Tips not covered in official docs
- Questions starting with "Has anyone..."

## Key Doc Pages Quick Reference

Read [references/docs-index.md](references/docs-index.md) to find the right URL for any topic. Key areas:

- **Setup & install**: `/en/overview`, `/en/quickstart`, `/en/setup`
- **CLAUDE.md & memory**: `/en/memory`
- **Best practices**: `/en/best-practices`, `/en/common-workflows`
- **Extending Claude Code**: `/en/features-overview`, `/en/skills`, `/en/hooks`, `/en/hooks-guide`, `/en/mcp`, `/en/sub-agents`
- **CLI reference**: `/en/cli-reference`
- **IDE integrations**: `/en/vs-code`, `/en/jetbrains`
- **Settings & permissions**: `/en/settings`, `/en/permissions`
- **Troubleshooting**: `/en/troubleshooting`

## Common Questions Answered Without Fetching

These facts are stable enough to answer directly:

**Installation**: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` (macOS/Linux/WSL). Homebrew: `brew install --cask claude-code`. The CLI command is `claude`.

**CLAUDE.md hierarchy**: managed policy → user (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) → project (`./CLAUDE.md`) → local (`CLAUDE.local.md`). Keep files under 200 lines. Run `/init` to generate a starter file.

**Context window management**: Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks. Run `/compact` to summarize. Auto-compaction triggers near context limits.

**Session resume**: `claude --continue` (most recent), `claude --resume` (picker), `claude --resume <name>`.

**Plan Mode**: `Shift+Tab` to cycle modes, or `--permission-mode plan`. Use before multi-file changes.

**Hooks vs CLAUDE.md**: Hooks are deterministic scripts that always run; CLAUDE.md is advisory context Claude may or may not follow.

**Skills vs Subagents**: Skills are reusable knowledge/workflows loaded into context. Subagents run in isolated context and return summaries.
